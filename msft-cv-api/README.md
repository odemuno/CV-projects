# Computer Vision using Azure Cognitive Services
 
 # Overview
This is a personal project. 

I am currently learning Python and I just completed the [Getting started with Python](https://github.com/microsoft/c9-python-getting-started). 

One of the modules is on APIs and the example we covered was the Computer Vision API on Azure Cognitive Services. I decided to explore this API a bit more using the [Analyze method](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa). I modified the code to create two seperate applications:
1. Who is a Celebrity?
2. Being Black in STEM

# Goal
- To explore what the capabilities of the CV API using Visual Studio Code and Python
- To observe and draw conclusions from the results derived from the images the algorithm processes, by highlighting it's strengths and flaws in relation to the confidence scores
