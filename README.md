# Azure Cognitive Services - Computer Vision
## Personal Background
I am an Electrical Engineering student with a focus in Machine Learning and Controls.  I chose to use [Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/) because it is a very efficient resource for developers to learn about and build AI services. It offers a platform for me to learn about sets of machine learning algorithms and intelligent applications. So, here you will find my personal projects with the Azure  Vision Cognitive Services. Also, most of the technical knowledge I've acquired regarding cognitive services have been through YouTube or Microsoft Learn!

## Overview
> Cognitive Services bring AI within reach of every developerâ€”without requiring machine-learning expertise. All it takes is an API call to embed the ability to see, hear, speak, search, understand, and accelerate decision-making into your apps.

Within the Vision Cognitive Services, you have;
- Computer Vision
- Custom Vision
- Face
- Form Recognizer
- Ink Recognizer
- Video Indexer

Currently, I have only worked with the Computer Vision API.
